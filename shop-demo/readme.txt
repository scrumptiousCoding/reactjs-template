Application was made with normal bootstrap though I found a few sources that stated using react-bootstrap would deliver a cleaner and smaller project.
I choose to stick to normal bootstrap because there was no distinction made that I could use the library though it would have been my choice to (just so I could see what
it could do and how it works)
